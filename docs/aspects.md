Aspects & Task
============================

Together with a panel of colleagues with diverse expertese, we identified a number of aspects which are important when selecting LLMs for different use cases.
We explore these aspects, their definition, as well as benchmarks which can be used to measure the desired model qualities or abilities.
We aim to quantify LLMs' performance on these aspects in order to present a single final score and a simple overview on our [leaderboard](https://amsterdam.github.io/grip-on-llms/nl/).
In this way, we try to support our colleagues in short-listing models for different use cases.
We believe that further qualitative evaluation of the short-listed models must be performed on case by case basis, within the concrete context and together with domain experts and users.

So far, we've been working on exploring the following aspects:

- **Inclusion**: WIP
- **Reasoning abilities**: WIP
- **[Factuality](./benchmarks_factuality.md)**: The model's ability to accurately answer objective knowledge-based questions about certain facts, such as those related to science or geography.
- **[Honesty](./benchmarks_honesty.md)**: The model's ability to admit when they do not know something and to avoid confident fabrication (hallucination).
- **Quality for Use Cases**: Quality assessment for specific tasks, e.g. [**Simplification**](./benchmarks_simplification.md), [**Summarization**](./benchmarks_summarization.md), TBA
- **Training Data**: Information about the training datasets, including level of transparency, responsible collection and annotation, issues related to privacy or copyrights, level of inclusivity and representation of Dutch language and society.
- [**Sustainability**](./sustainability.md): The impact of the model on the environment during its full life-cycle, from training to inference.


### Future Work

In the future, we plan to add the following aspects:

- **Ethical Development**:
- **Political Preferences**: Assessment of political biases.
- **Safety**: Safety measures and risk mitigation.
- **Support of Digital Autonomy**:
- **Costs**: Costs for hosting and inference.
- **Dutch Language**: Performance in Dutch language.
- **Dutch Culture**: Knowledge about Dutch culture.
- **Knowledge of Amsterdam**: Specific knowledge about Amsterdam and the municipality.
