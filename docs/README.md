Documentation
============================

Here, you can find all important information about our [leaderboard](https://amsterdam.github.io/grip-on-llms), the choices behind it and its practical implementation. 

Most importantly, there are:

- an [overview of the aspects](./aspects.md) which we aim to evaluate, as well as individual pages with deep-dives into each one of them (e.g. about [factuality](./benchmarks_factuality.md) or [simplification](./benchmarks_simplification.md))
- explanation of how to select and add [benchmarks](./benchmarks.md) for these aspects
- description of our [Model Zoo](./models.md) including information on how to add new models
