# Grip on LLMs


While Large Language Models (LLMs) provide significant opportunities
for governmental organization to automate processes and improve services for citizens,
there is limited research and knowledge into the level to which
current models reflect the ethical standards and cultural nuances of Dutch society.


This repository contains code and methodologies related to the evaluation
of the performance, environmental impact and alignment of Large Language Models
with human values.
