page_title: LLM Overview
mission: "To encourage the responsible use of Large Language Models, we create an overview of models, which can be used for Dutch municipal use cases."

  title: Energy Estimate Impossible
  explanation: "Because this is a closed model, it is impossible to calculate how much energy it uses. If you would like to take care of the environment, we advise you to use a model for which this information is available."

score_explanation:
  factuality:
    intro: "
      We measure factuality using the environmentally friendly,
      tiny versions versions three benchmarks known as
      <a href=https://huggingface.co/datasets/tinyBenchmarks/tinyMMLU target='_blank'>MMLU</a>,
      <a href=https://huggingface.co/datasets/tinyBenchmarks/tinyAI2_arc target='_blank'>ARC</a>, and
      <a href=https://huggingface.co/datasets/tinyBenchmarks/tinyTruthfulQA target='_blank'>TruthfulQA</a>.
      These benchmarks consist of multiple-choice questions, such as:"
    example: |
      Which of the following is considered an acid anhydride?
      A: HCl
      B: H2SO3
      C: SO2
      D: Al(NO3)3
    outro: "
      We know the answers to these questions and can calculate
      how often the model answered correctly."
  simplification:
    intro: "
      We measure simplification abilities using pairs of complex sentences
      together with their corresponding simple versions -
      written or verified by experts and users.
      For example:"
    example: |
      Complex: This outlines the ambition to realize at least 127 MW of wind energy in Amsterdam by 2030.
      Simple: This states that Amsterdam wants to generate at least 127 MW of wind energy by 2030.
    outro: "
      We ask an LLM to simplify each complex sentence,
      and then we calculate how similar its simplification is to the one in the dataset.
      "
  summarization:
    intro: "
      We measure summarization abilities using two benchmarks known as
      <a href=https://huggingface.co/datasets/EdinburghNLP/xsum target='_blank'>XSum</a> and
      <a href=https://huggingface.co/datasets/abisee/cnn_dailymail target='_blank'>CNN/DailyMail</a>.
      These benchmarks contain pairs of news articles together with a proposed summarization.
      "
    example:
    outro: "
      We ask an LLM to summarize each article,
      and then we calculate how similar the summary is to the one in the dataset.
      "
  energy_use:
    intro: "
      We measure environmental impact using a tool called CodeCarbon.
      This tool tracks how long a program runs and
      how much computational resources and energy are used.
      Afterwards, it calculates how much carbon dioxide is emitted
      depending on the geographic area where servers are located."
    example:
    outro: "
      We use CodeCarbon when we run all other benchmarks
      and then calculate an average score per model."
